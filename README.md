# CI2024_project-work

**Project Description**

This repository contains the work carried out for the project assignment in the Computational Intelligence course. The primary goal was to develop a Symbolic Regression algorithm based on the Genetic Programming (GP) technique, capable of finding mathematical functions that best approximate complex datasets.

Although the project was challenging—especially considering my lack of prior experience with Python or computational intelligence—the journey was incredibly educational. Through the implementation of this algorithm, I had the opportunity to deepen my understanding of both theoretical and practical aspects of evolutionary algorithms.

**Key Features**

- Symbolic Regression Algorithm: Utilizes Genetic Programming (GP) to evolve mathematical functions that best fit the provided data.
- Automated Solution Evaluation: The algorithm computes the Mean Squared Error (MSE) to measure the quality of the solutions found.
- Adaptability to Datasets: The algorithm has been tested on a variety of problems with variable input and target values, demonstrating both strengths and limitations.
